## About me

My name is Paula Borowiec. For quite a long time I have been unconsciously testing and checking out of sheer curiosity whether web applications work properly. Taking this into account, and adding to it my inquisitiveness and perfectionism, I enrolled in an "intensive" 116-hour course "Software Tester", where I have been gaining the necessary knowledge for this profession and the needed preparation for the ISTQB exam.

## GIT and HTTP

During the course, I not only learned how to test, but developed my skills in many directions among others:

I learned how to work with the GIT tool (and Github)

I learned the basics of REST API and web tools, so that in my future work, I will be able to test the back-end with the right tools.
